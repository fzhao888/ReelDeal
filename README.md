# Credits
HUGE shoutout to TA Jessica.  We could not have finished this project without her help.  She was instrumental in helping us save and remove from local storage. 
In addition, she helped us a lot in checking if our webpage was responsive and gave a lot of helpful pointers in styling our webpage.   

Shoutout to Bulma documentations ( https://bulma.io/documentation/ ). We took inspiration styling the card component, modals, button, navbar, image, and responsiveness from the Bulma documentations.    

We also used w3 school ( https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_his_back.asp )to help us out with the back button. 

Lastly, we also took a lot of inspiration from University of Minnesota edX bootcamp class examples.  06-Server-Side-APIs Mini Project helps get us going and helped us come out with the idea of using a result card.  

Not sure, if we need to cite our picture of the "dog", we got it from https://gallery.ryux.net/gallery.php?anime=fma&section=07&start=311&perpage=10 .
